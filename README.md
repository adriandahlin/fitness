This is a Python 3 application for logging and viewing fitness data. It has two parts. First, fitness.py allows you to enter your own workouts into a database and view the data. Second, google_sheet_to_csv.py reads data from my publicly shared Google Sheet (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oI0gf7m68ZrrL5ITTYYvxDdP8NzY5mwmlzb4Y3oGpjA/edit#gid=1015976883) and adds it to a database that can then be viewed.

STEPS:

1) Install required packages:
  pip install -r requirements.txt # if you're running Python 3.x on a machine with Python 2.x as default, use pip3

2) Run app/fitness.py.

3) Run app/google_sheet_to_csv.py.
